## Project Overview

By understanding and visualizing the nutritional adequacy of Tanzanian diets, and researching nutritional outcomes in Tanzaniaâ€™s historical, social, and political context, we have discovered that a large area for nutritional improvement in Tanzania is Vitamin A. Based on this finding we have developed a few policies:  

1. Increasing the Vitamin A intake
2. Using eggs as a method to increase Vitamin A intake
3. Using technological methods in order to increase the natural Vitamin A content of eggs

## Methods

We utilized the datasets given in class (FDC, FCT, World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study), and found outside sources (Tanzania's Prime Minister's Office) in order to find supplementary nutrition information. With these datasets, we created a regression object and constructed a demand system, constructed a nutrition system, and used these systems to analyze the nutrition of Tanzania. After seeing that Vitamin A deficiencies are a big concern in Tanzania, we experimented with different policies via our Policy Simulator, before coming up with our final 3. 

## Files

Our final file is labeled **Tanzania_Final.ipynb**. The deliverables 1.3 - 1.6 are labeled within the file. Our actual unit tests code is within the **unit_tests.py** file. Our policy simulator is in the **Policy_Simulation_Final.ipynb** file. Our Tanzania map is under **Map-Of-Tanzania-By-Region.ipynb** file.
