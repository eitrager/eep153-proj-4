## Project Overview

By understanding and visualizing the nutritional adequacy of Tanzanian diets, and researching nutritional outcomes in Tanzaniaâ€™s historical, social, and political context, we have discovered that a large area for nutritional improvement in Tanzania is Vitamin A. Based on this finding we have developed a few policies:  

1. Increasing the Vitamin A intake
2. Using eggs as a method to increase Vitamin A intake
3. Using technological methods in order to increase the natural Vitamin A content of eggs
